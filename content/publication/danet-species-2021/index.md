abstract: Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning and food-web complexity–stability relationships
  are central to ecology. However, they remain largely untested in natural contexts.
  Here, we estimated the links among environmental conditions, richness, food-web
  structure, annual biomass and its temporal stability using a standardised monitoring
  dataset of 99 stream fish communities spanning from 1995 to 2018. We first revealed
  that both richness and average trophic level are positively related to annual biomass,
  with effects of similar strength. Second, we found that community stability is fostered
  by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species
  richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and
  its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly,
  the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population
  stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic
  communities. We discuss the hypothesis that it could be a characteristic of multi-trophic
  communities.
