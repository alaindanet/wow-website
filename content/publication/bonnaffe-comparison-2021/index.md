abstract: It is predicted that warmer conditions should lead to a loss of trophic
  levels, as larger bodied consumers, which occupy higher trophic levels, experience
  higher metabolic costs at high temperature. Yet, it is unclear whether this prediction
  is consistent with the effect of warming on the trophic structure of natural systems.
  Furthermore, effects of temperature at the species level, which arise through a
  change in species composition, may differ from those at the population level, which
  arise through a change in population structure. We investigate this by building
  species-level trophic networks, and size-structured trophic networks, as a proxy
  for population structure, for 18 648 stream fish communities, from 4 145 234 individual
  fish samples, across 7024 stream locations in France from 1980 to 2008. We estimated
  effects of temperature on total trophic diversity (total number of nodes), vertical
  trophic diversity (mean and maximum trophic level) and distribution of biomass across
  trophic level (correlation between trophic level and biomass) in these networks.
  We found a positive effect of temperature on total trophic diversity in both species-
  and size-structured trophic networks. We found that maximum trophic level and biomass
  distribution decreased in species-level and size-structured trophic networks, but
  the mean trophic level decreased only in size-structured trophic networks. These
  results show that warmer temperatures associate with a lower vertical trophic diversity
  in size-structured networks, and a higher one in species-level networks. This suggests
  that vertical trophic diversity is shaped by antagonistic effects of temperature
  on population structure and on species composition. Our results hence demonstrate
  that effects of temperature do not only differ across trophic levels, but also across
  levels of biological organisation, from population to species level, implying complex
  changes in network structure and functioning with warming.
