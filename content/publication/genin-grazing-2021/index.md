abstract: Interactions are key drivers of the functioning and fate of plant communities.
  A traditional way to measure them is to use pairwise experiments, but such experiments
  do not scale up to species-rich communities. For those, using association networks
  based on spatial patterns may provide a more realistic approach. While this method
  has been successful in abiotically-stressed environments (alpine and arid ecosystems),
  it is unclear how well it generalizes to other types of environments. We help fill
  this knowledge gap by documenting how the structure of plant communities changes
  in a Mediterranean dry grassland grazed by sheep using plant spatial association
  networks. We investigated how the structure of these networks changed with grazing
  intensity to show the effect of biotic disturbance on community structure. We found
  that these grazed grassland communities were mostly dominated by negative associations,
  suggesting a dominance of interference over facilitation regardless of the disturbance
  level. The topology of the networks revealed that the number of associations were
  not evenly-distributed across species, but rather that a small subset of species
  established most negative associations under low grazing conditions. All these aspects
  of spatial organization vanished under high level of grazing as association networks
  became more similar to null expectations. Our study shows that grazed herbaceous
  plant communities display a highly non-random organization that responds strongly
  to disturbance and can be measured through association networks. This approach thus
  appears insightful to test general hypotheses about plant communities, and in particular
  understand how anthropogenic perturbations affect the organization of ecological
  communities.
