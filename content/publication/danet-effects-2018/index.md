abstract: 'Question Positive interactions between plants have well-known effects on
  community species richness and biomass via micro-environment improvements. However,
  the effects of indirect facilitation performed by a nurse on an associated plant
  community, occurring e.g., through protection against grazing, have not attracted
  much attention in the literature so far, in particular regarding the functional
  traits of the associated plant communities. Because characteristics of trait distributions
  can reveal selective pressures at play, they offer valuable information for the
  study of grazing pressure. Here, we tested the extent to which indirect facilitation
  affects the amount of distinct trait combinations (H1), trait dominance (H2) and
  niche differentiation between species (H3) of associated plant communities living
  under nurse plants. Location Tropical alpine peatlands, Cordillera Real, Bolivia.
  Methods We set up a grazing exclusion experiment over two dominant nurse cushion
  species: one providing indirect facilitation under grazing pressure and the other
  not. We measured three functional traits in the associated communities, which are
  known to vary depending on the grazing level: LDMC, leaf thickness and maximum height.
  We assessed the amount of distinct trait combinations by computing the volume of
  the phenotypic space (H1). The variation in trait dominance was quantified with
  kurtosis and skewness of the trait distributions (H2). The variation in niche differentiation
  was evaluated using mean intra-population trait variance relative to intra-community
  trait variance (H3). Results We did not find a significant effect of grazing and
  indirect facilitation on the volume of the phenotypic space (H1). However, our study
  revealed a significant effect of indirect facilitation on dominance in the associated
  communities by maintaining the evenness of the trait distributions (maximum height
  and leaf thickness) in grazed compared to ungrazed plots (H2), and on niche differentiation
  by maintaining trait overlaps (LDMC and maximum height) between species in grazed
  compared to ungrazed contexts (H3). Conclusion Our results suggest that indirect
  facilitation promotes the co-existence of contrasting functional strategies (H2)
  and species niches (H3) in associated plant communities subject to grazing. These
  results reflect the buffering effect of indirect facilitation on the grazing selective
  pressures exerted on associated plant communities living under the protection of
  nurses.'
