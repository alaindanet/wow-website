abstract: Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental
  conditions, once a threshold in conditions—or critical point—is passed. This can
  lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic
  consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs
  or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been
  devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts
  and avoid their negative consequences. Theoretical and empirical research has shown
  that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in
  its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively
  simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as “early warning signals”
  (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising,
  empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular
  for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity
  to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological
  systems. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial
  EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to
  permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time
  steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatialwarnings
  (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way,
  and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data. This software
  package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers
  and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application,
  it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute
  to providing tools to map ecosystems’ fragility to perturbations and inform management
  decisions.
