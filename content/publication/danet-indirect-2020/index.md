abstract: Dryland ecosystems are likely to respond discontinuously to gradual changes
  in environmental conditions. Direct facilitation between plants, whereby plants
  improve the local environmental conditions for others, has been shown to be a mechanism
  contributing to these discontinuous ecosystem transitions. Theoretical models describing
  dryland vegetation dynamics often consider a single plant species and one type of
  facilitation, namely direct facilitation. However, another type of facilitation–indirect
  facilitation–is widespread in dryland ecosystems as well; it is performed by plants
  protected against grazing, the nurses, when this protection extends to other plants
  growing in their neighbourhood that are deprived of such protection, the protegees.
  Little is known about the long-term effects of indirect facilitation on dryland
  dynamics. Here, we developed and analysed a theoretical model including two species–a
  nurse and a protegee–and indirect facilitation through grazing. We investigated
  the effects of indirect facilitation on species composition, species spatial clustering
  and the stability of dryland ecosystems. We showed that indirect facilitation through
  grazing enables the stable coexistence of the nurse and the protegee and allows
  the reversibility of the protegee extinction. Surprisingly, the strength of indirect
  facilitation affected neither the total nor the interspecific vegetation clustering.
  Our study highlights that spatially explicit grazing protection may affect species
  composition and the stability of dryland ecosystems and gives hints about how species
  interactions translate into spatial clustering.
