 abstract = {Interactions between organisms are key drivers of community composition and ecosystem functioning. Ecology has a long history of studies on negative interactions, such as predation and competition. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of positive interactions, such as facilitation in nature. The integration of these interactions into modern ecological theory has nonetheless lagged behind. This thesis aims at contributing to this research effort and addresses two core questions : (i) How does indirect facilitation (through protection against grazing) affect the functional structure (characteristics of trait distributions) of plant communities? (ii) Does the net effect of the interactions between a species pair (benefactor-beneficiary) remain valid in the presence of several beneficiary species at community level? We set up two insitu experiments in contrasted environments: a grazing exclusion experiment in tropical alpine peatlands and a transplantation experiment of sapling communities beneath adult plants in a mediterranean environment. Our results showed that indirect facilitation affects the characteristics of the environmental filter, species dominance and niche differentiation in the community. Our results also suggested that the composition of sapling communities modifies adult-sapling interactions, thereby questioning the possibility of extrapolating results from pairs of individuals to the community scale.},
