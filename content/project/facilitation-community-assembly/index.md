Ecology has a long history of studies on negative interactions, such as
predation and competition. Although, numerous studies have highlighted the
importance of positive interactions, such as facilitation. The integration of
facilitation into modern ecological theory has nonetheless lagged behind. In
particular, we had little evidences of the effects of positive interactions on
community structure.

Facilitation has been extensively studied in plants. It happens when a plant
(called *nurse*), increase the fitness of another plant (called *beneficiary*).
We can distinguish direct and indirect facilitation. Direct facilitation arises
when a nurse improves its surrounding environment by increasing amount of
resources such as water and nutrients. Indirect facilitation occurs when there
is at least a third species. When a nurse decreases the predation rate of an
herbivore on plants, there is an indirect positive link from the nurse toward
the beneficiary. 

My PhD aimed to explore the effects of plant-plant interactions at the community
scale, with a focus on indirect interaction and positive interactions. The main
research question was: What are the effects of a nurse plant on the community
of beneficiary ?

In the first place, we looked at the effects of different nurse strategies
against grazing on the community structure of the beneficiaries (paper [on
filtering](https://alaindanet.github.io/publication/filtering-bolivia/) and on
[dominance and niche
differentiation](https://alaindanet.github.io/publication/assembly-bolivia/)).
In the other side, we examined the effects beneficiary community composition on
the
relationship that they had with the nurse (work still in preparation).
Finally, using a theoretical model, we investigated the effects of indirect
facilitation through grazing on [species composition, ecosystem dynamics and
species clustering](https://alaindanet.github.io/publication/assembly-bolivia/indirect_facilitation_model).
